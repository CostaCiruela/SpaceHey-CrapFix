# SpaceHey-EnterKeyFix
UserScript that allows you to send a chat message by pressing the "enter" key instead of using SpaceHey default crap.

### How
- I used the default FireFox tools to check the default JavaScript used by the chat client to find out a few things and the rest is just basic shit.

### Why
- I'm fucking tired of clicking the SEND icon or having to press CTRL+ENTER all the time. Decent, normal websites let you press Enter to send the message, but SpaceHey seems to like being a prick. Now you can type anything to any user, then press ENTER, and the message will be sent. You can still make a new line of text by holding SHIFT and then ENTER.

### Install

- If you are not dumb or blind, I think you can assume with common sense that you can open the file called "[spaceheyshit.user.js](https://github.com/CostaCiruela/SpaceHey-EnterKeyFix/raw/main/spaceheyshit.user.js)" and install it with some extension like Tampermonkey or similar. You can also copy the code from the file and add it manually.

# SpaceHey-Recent blogs "button"
UserScript that adds a clock emoji button next to "Blog". Click it and will take you to Recent blogs.

### How
- Basic redirect shit, no need to explain. I added comments to the code so you bitches can stop crying about "bwah bwah what if this is malware". My brother in christ you can literally see the code HERE and wathever script addon you are using.

### Why
- Fucking tired of having to click BLOGS *then* RECENT. Top entries are shit full of drama and dumb kids. SpaceHey owners for some fucking reason they split the site into sub-domains and urls and make you have to go to page after page for basic things. So trying to fix that, at least the blogs part.

### Install

- Same method. Install "[AddRecentblogButton.user.js](https://github.com/CostaCiruela/SpaceHey-CrapFix/raw/main/AddRecentblogButton.user.js)". You can also copy the code from the file and add it manually.


## âš Extra notes

- "Does this violate the ToS or rules? Will I be banned if I use these scripts?" Short answer is no. I don't want to share this in Spacehey itself because moderation sucks and users are really dumb, so answering their doubts would be stressing af. You can read the Tos and Rules, and find stuff like "NO JS ALLOWED" but thats there for the safety of the users and talks about JS modifications that affect **everyone**, this scripts are client-side only. Also, it talks about not using anything regarding the API and stuff like that but that's not the case here either, I don't need to access the site API to do any of this or to ensure it works. So yeah relax.

- In case the code breaks in the future, I'm not sure if I'm going to update it or not. I just made an account there to fuck around for a moment and that's it, so I have no major interest in the site or in maintaining the script. They hardly ever update anything anyway, so it should work fine for some time. If not, you have the code at your fucking fingertips, edit it and fix it.
