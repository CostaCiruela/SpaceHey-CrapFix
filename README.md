[ðŸ”—SpaceHey post](https://blog.spacehey.com/entry?id=797632). It contains extra information, ideas and so on. Don't expect to find direct links to the scripts or their code there, this is more of an "promotion" post if you can say it that way. For questions, bug reports and the like, there is a link to send me a DM which I will keep an eye on as long as I use the site. I will keep the post updated if anything new comes up here.

# SpaceHey-EnterKeyFix
UserScript that allows you to send a chat message by pressing the "enter" key instead of using SpaceHey default crap.

### How
- I used the default FireFox tools to check the default JavaScript used by the chat client to find out a few things and the rest is just basic shit.

### Why
- I'm fucking tired of clicking the SEND icon or having to press CTRL+ENTER all the time. Decent, normal websites let you press Enter to send the message, but SpaceHey seems to like being a prick. Now you can type anything to any user, then press ENTER, and the message will be sent. You can still make a new line of text by holding SHIFT and then ENTER.

### Install

- If you are not dumb or blind, I think you can assume with common sense that you can open the file called "[spaceheyshit.user.js](https://github.com/CostaCiruela/SpaceHey-EnterKeyFix/raw/main/spaceheyshit.user.js)" and install it with some extension like Tampermonkey or similar. You can also copy the code from the file and add it manually.

# SpaceHey-Recent blogs "button"
UserScript that adds a clock emoji button next to "Blog". Click it and will take you to Recent blogs.

### How
- Basic redirect shit, no need to explain. I added comments to the code so you bitches can stop crying about "bwah bwah what if this is malware". My brother in christ you can literally see the code HERE and wathever script addon you are using.

### Why
- Fucking tired of having to click BLOGS *then* RECENT. Top entries are shit full of drama and dumb kids. SpaceHey owners for some fucking reason they split the site into sub-domains and urls and make you have to go to page after page for basic things. So trying to fix that, at least the blogs part.

### Install

- Same method. Install "[AddRecentblogButton.user.js](https://github.com/CostaCiruela/SpaceHey-CrapFix/raw/main/AddRecentblogButton.user.js)". You can also copy the code from the file and add it manually.

  
# SpaceHey - Hide layout (aka. SpaceBye)
UserScript that can hide most of custom CSS, i.e. layouts.

### How
- Just CSS rules, mainly. Most of CSS and HTML the user puts in "About Me" should be hidden. This includes (but not limited to) custom cursor, snowflakes, pfp animations or custom shapes, custom backgrounds, custom color, and custom overlays. Not sure about embeds or audio files. NOTE: This script will not prevent the loading of any extra resources (be it the css itself or images). The CSS itself will be loaded successfully, and then this script will be applied (it has a two second delay). Why? Simple, this is not a content blocker but simply a hider. The user custom css must load successfully before it can be hidden or it may fail.

### Why
- No sad backstory here, this was just a test. I know this is like a blasphemy against the entire profile custom stuff. I will not add any specific button or function within the website itself to enable or disable this, so you must handle it from your userscript manager.

### Install

- Same method. Install "[spacebye_hidecss.user.js](https://github.com/CostaCiruela/SpaceHey-CrapFix/raw/main/spacebye_hidecss.user.js)". You can also copy the code from the file and add it manually.

# [CSS]SpaceHey - Properly hide the friend list
Basic CSS to properly hide your friend list.

### How
- Ok, this is extremely basic but it simply allows you to hide your friends list with CSS, including: The section itself, number of friends, names and pfps, and so on.

### Why
- All the current codes I found are either incomplete, or they don't work to hide number of friends, pfps, or they remove the entire friends section INCLUDING comments, which is not the idea here.

### Usage

- Paste the [CSS](https://github.com/CostaCiruela/SpaceHey-CrapFix/raw/main/hidefriendlist.css) code while editing your profile in "About Me".

## âš Extra notes

- "Does this violate the ToS or rules? Will I be banned if I use these scripts?" Short answer is no. I don't want to share this in Spacehey itself because moderation sucks and users are really dumb, so answering their doubts would be stressing af. You can read the Tos and Rules, and find stuff like "NO JS ALLOWED" but thats there for the safety of the users and talks about JS modifications that affect **everyone**, this scripts are client-side only. Also, it talks about not using anything regarding the API and stuff like that but that's not the case here either, I don't need to access the site API to do any of this or to ensure it works. So yeah relax.

- In case the code breaks in the future, I'm not sure if I'm going to update it or not. I just made an account there to fuck around for a moment and that's it, so I have no major interest in the site or in maintaining the script. They hardly ever update anything anyway, so it should work fine for some time. If not, you have the code at your fucking fingertips, edit it and fix it.
