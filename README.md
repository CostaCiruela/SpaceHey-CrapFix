# SpaceHey-EnterKeyFix
UserScript that allows you to send a chat message by pressing the "enter" key instead of using SpaceHey default crap.

### How
- I used the default FireFox tools to check the default JavaScript used by the chat client to find out a few things and the rest is just basic shit.

### Why
- I'm fucking tired of clicking the SEND icon or having to press CTRL+ENTER all the time. Decent, normal websites let you press Enter to send the message, but SpaceHey seems to like being a prick. Now you can type anything to any user, then press ENTER, and the message will be sent. You can still make a new line of text by holding SHIFT and then ENTER.

### Install

- If you are not dumb or blind, I think you can assume with common sense that you can open the single file called "spaceheyshit.user.js" and install it with some extension like Tampermonkey or similar. You can also copy the code from the file and add it manually.

#### Extra stuff
In case the code breaks in the future, I'm not sure if I'm going to update it or not. I just made an account there to fuck around for a moment and that's it, so I have no major interest in the site or in maintaining the script. They hardly ever update anything anyway, so it should work fine for some time. If not, you have the code at your fucking fingertips, edit it and fix it.
